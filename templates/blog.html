            <h2>Using Flask and Machine Learning to Develop a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web Application</h2>
        </div>

        <p>It is more important than ever to have access to quick and accurate healthcare in the information and
            technology age. In light of the growing significance of remote healthcare solutions, we set out to create a
            web application for symptom-based disease detection. With the use of a Support Vector Classifier model and
            Flask for the backend, we developed an intuitive platform that assists users in identifying possible
            illnesses based on the symptoms they have reported.
        </p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The initiative started with identifying a common problem: people frequently have symptoms and seek prompt
            resolutions for their medical issues. Differentiating between different diseases can be difficult,
            particularly when symptoms are similar. Our intention was to offer a user-friendly way for people to enter
            their symptoms and get possible diagnosis.
        </p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>We created a web application that enables users to list the symptoms they are having. Based on the given
            symptoms, the app then employs a pre-trained Support Vector Classifier model to determine which disease is
            most likely. This is how it operates:

            <div class="card-header">
                How It Works
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Symptom Input:</b> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface. The web app
                        supports a wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.</li>
                    <li><b>Machine Learning Model:</b> We trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset containing
                        symptoms and corresponding diseases. The model is capable of predicting diseases based on input
                        symptoms.</li>
                    <li><b>Prediction:</b> The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users
                        with instant information about potential health concerns.</li>
                    <li><b>Additional Information:</b> To enhance user experience, the app also provides additional
                        information about the predicted disease. This includes a description of the disease, recommended
                        precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</li>
                </ol>

                        predictions based on the symptoms provided by the user.</li>
                    <li><b>Comprehensive Information:</b> In addition to predictions, the app offers comprehensive
                        information about the predicted disease, including descriptions, precautions, medications, diet
                        recommendations, and workout tips.</li>
                    <li><b>Educational Content:</b> To empower users with knowledge, the app includes informative blog
                        posts about various health topics.</li>
